          <span>What is Webpage Design? </span><br><br>
          <p>Web design itself refers to the process 
            of creating a web pageâ€™s appearance and 
            to the choice of a right color scheme, 
            page layout, fonts and more. Every single 
            web page in a website has different content, 
            but all the pages are using a similar graphic 
            design. Often sites will use website templates, 
            which contain all the basic elements of web design
             - the website's CSS style, buttons, backgrounds, 
             borders and various graphic elements like hover 
             images, bullets and header banners. When the 
             website template is applied to the website, 
             all the pages assume its appearance, using 
             the same styles, background and other 
             graphical elements.</p>
